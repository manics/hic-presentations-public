# How Can a Standard Architecture for Trusted Research Environments Provide a Framework for HPC?

# The Health Informatics Centre (HIC)

The vision:

![float-right w:200](hic-chicken-tony.jpg)

> To advance data science and its community, simplifying access to sensitive data whilst maintaining security as a global leader in open, reproducible and scalable research platforms

https://www.dundee.ac.uk/hic

![bg fit right:35%](hic-expertise.png)

<!--
Part of the School of Medicine, University of Dundee

Mission Statement: "To Innovate and enable world-leading data science research specialising in sensitive data"

- HIC supports high impact research through the collection and management of population based data
- We have expert teams in secure data management, governance, data engineering, research infrastructure, software, and business support
-->

---
## We provide access to national healthcare data for researchers

- Including electronic health records and medical images
- We're data curators/processors on behalf of data controllers
- And are part of the Scottish Safe Haven network

# Purpose of this talk
- Explain what Trusted Research Environments (TREs) are
- Why existing HPC is not generally usable for TREs
- How we can start fixing that

---
# What are TREs and why do we need them?

<!--
Example motivating case

---
# Example: Can undiagnosed heart failure be detected from routine medical records?

## How can we give researchers access to the data?
- Can we give them a USB stick with all patient medical data to copy to their laptop?

![bg right](usb-drive.jpg)

---
## NO! There are many reasons not to

[![drop-shadow:0,5px,10px,rgba(0,0,0,.4) w:800 centre](northern-trains-lost-propertry.png)](https://media.northernrailway.co.uk/news/the-hamster-the-wig-and-the-cupboard-northern-customers-report-more-than-32-600-items-of-lost-property)

- So what can we do instead?

---
## We could minimise the data given to the researcher...
- Data minimisation: Only provide relevant fields from relevant records
- Pseudonymisation
- Use "synthetic" data

![bg fit right](excel-data-hidden.png)

---
<!--
_footer: https://securedatagroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/sdc-handbook-v2.0.pdf
-->

## ... and limit what they can publish

![h:500](sdc-maps.png)

<!--
For example ensure only summary statistics can be published
-->
---
## We could accredit researchers to ensure they know their responsibilities...
- training courses on how to handle sensitive data
- understand why it's important to handle sensitive data in this way
- ensure that researchers are "trusted" before they can access patient data

[![width:800 float-right](mrc-research-gdpr-training.png)](https://bygsystems.net/mrcrsc-lms/course/index.php?categoryid=1)

---
## ... along with reviewing what they plan to do
- Research projects in the healthcare field already go through ethics review
- is the proposed work in the public interest?
- does it include safeguards to protect patient data?

---
## We could impose virtual or physical barriers on what they can do
- provide a locked-down compute environment with access to the data but no ability to copy data out
![centre](computers-no-connection.drawio.svg)
- or only allow access to data from a physical location monitored with CCTV

# Why do we need a "standard" for TREs?

In the UK 50+ TREs have organically developed over the past 15+ years.
- Duplication of effort
- Most TREs were developed independently, making them harder to maintain
- Every TRE feels different to researchers, more time is wasted understanding how each TRE works
- No single TRE has all the data you want

## Example capability: Network Management

|  | Statement | Guidance | Importance |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2.2.9. | Your TRE must control and manage all of its network infrastructure in order to protect information in systems and applications. | Network infrastructure must prevent unauthorised access to resources on the network. This may include firewalls, network segmentation, and restricting connections to the network. | Mandatory |
| 2.2.10. | Your TRE must not allow connectivity between users in different projects, or with access to different datasets. | Connectivity between users in the same project may be allowed,  for example to support shared network services within the project. | Mandatory |
| 2.2.11. | Your TRE must block outbound connections to the internet by default. | Limited outbound connectivity may be allowed for some services. | Mandatory |
| 2.2.12. | You should be able to monitor the network configuration of your TRE to check for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities. | This may include regular vulnerability scanning, and penetration testing. | Recommended |
| 2.2.13. | You should regularly monitor the network configuration of your TRE to check for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities. | This will involve following the monitoring procedure detailed above. | Recommended |

## Not yet in SATRE: federation

SATRE is a common baseline for TRE, so now we can work on federation as part of:

# Why do TREs need HPC?

Massive datasets, more complex analyses
- The Scottish Safe Haven Network collectively has 2+ PB of medical images

---
# How is HPC used in practice?
It mostly isn't

![bg fit right](eo_circle_red_no-entry.svg)

<!--
https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Eo_circle_red_no-entry.svg
-->
---
## Typical HPC has insufficient isolation for handling sensitive data
- Outbound network access: data can be copied out
- Shared filesystems/scratch space: people can see each other's data
- Internal network connections: data can be passed between different internal projects

![bg right:40%](datacentre.jpg)

---
## HPC information governance
- GDPR and other legislation applies
- HPC administrators may not be trained in handling sensitive data
- A typical TRE will be audited/accredited, e.g. to ISO27001

<!--

---
# The ultimate question
_Are the public (or data owner) happy with their sensitive data being analysed in shared HPC facilities?_

![bg right](scotparliament-people.jpg)

---
# What can we do?

- Understand the drivers behind the additional restrictions that TREs impose
- Think about what technical controls are practical using SATRE as a guide
  - Can new facilities include support for TREs?
  - How much can be retro-fitted to existing facilities?

## A few starting points
This is a very active area of development, but a few areas of investigation include:
- ephemeral SLURM clusters in public cloud
  - SLURM nodes are ephemeral, never shared between users, storage always encrypted
